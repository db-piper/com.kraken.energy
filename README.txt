The Kraken Energy app provides access to electricity import and export data from energy providers who use Kraken Technology to manage their customer data. It requires the use of a physical device such as the Octopus Home Mini that provides access (via Kraken) to live meter readings. There is no access provided to live data from gas tariffs, consequently this app does not support gas consumption data.

Tariff devices allow you to track the energy consumed or exported using the import and export tariffs linked to your Octopus account and to respond to changes in tariff prices at different times of day.

The Account device tracks the status of your account, including periodic invoices and account balance.
